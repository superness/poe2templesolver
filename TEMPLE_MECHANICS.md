# POE2 Temple of Atziri - Mechanics Documentation

## Overview

The Temple of Atziri is a dungeon-building system in Path of Exile 2's "Fate of the Vaal" league. Players construct a custom temple layout on a 9x9 grid, placing rooms and paths strategically to maximize rewards while managing destabilization mechanics.

## Getting Started

### Unlocking the Temple
1. Activate **6 Vaal Beacons** scattered throughout Wraeclast
2. Beacons are found in campaign areas and maps
3. After level 86+, beacons only appear in maps
4. Energize beacons by defeating nearby monsters, then approach them

### Temple Console
- Located in Vaal Ruins after unlocking beacons
- Displays 9x9 grid layout
- **Foyer** (entrance) on one side, **Atziri's Chamber** on opposite end
- Each run generates 6 "Room Cards" to place on the grid
- ~50% of cards are Paths (traversal only)

## Room Connection Rules

Rooms have **specific connection restrictions**:
- Garrison can only connect to: Path, Commander, Armoury, Synth Lab, Spymaster
- Some rooms have unique constraints (e.g., Sacrificial Chamber appears only once)
- Cannot place Spymaster after using Commander in a chain (possible bug)
- Architect's Chamber can connect directly to adjacent rooms (not just paths)

**Visual Indicator:** Synergy connections show brighter green outline with corner squares

---

## Destabilization Mechanics

### How Destabilization Works
- After each temple run, some rooms are randomly removed
- Destabilization can target any "loose" unprotected non-Reward rooms or Paths
- Fighting bosses increases destabilization:
  - **After Xipocado:** ~30% of temple removed, Architect's Chamber randomized
  - **After Atziri:** Many non-Path rooms, Royal Access Chamber, and most Paths removed

### The "Snake Chain" Strategy

Build a single linear path from entrance:

```
[Foyer] → [Path] → [Room] → [Room] → [Path] → [Room] → [LOCK]
```

**Key Rules:**
1. **Never loop** - closing the chain causes total collapse
2. **Avoid squares** - deletes locked sections
3. **Lock the tip** - decay only nibbles the end
4. **Locks preserve the middle** - protected rooms stay safe

### Protection Methods

1. **Medallion Locks** - Use at end of each run to protect chain tip
2. **Filler rooms** - Place expendable rooms in center first (gives system something to "eat")
3. **Tier 3 requirement** - Post-patch 0.4.0c, locks require tier 3 rooms

---

## Optimal Building Strategies

### Early Game Approach
```
Path → Guardhouse (buffer) → Dynamo (power) → Crimson Hall (corruption) → Path → Architect's Chamber
```

1. Upgrade Dynamo with Thaumaturge early
2. Start with Spy Master → Garrison for easy medallion locks
3. Or Corruption Chamber (optimal but lock-starved early)

### Balanced Temple (Recommended)
Stack multiple multipliers:
- **Effectiveness** (Commander, Armory variants)
- **Rarity** (Alchemy Labs, Vault rooms)
- **Extra Rare Mods** (Corruption Chambers)
- **Chest Density** (Sealed Vault, Treasure Vault)

A balanced temple outperforms one that only stacks one stat!

### Farming Strategies

| Goal | Focus |
|------|-------|
| XP Farming | Density rooms, conservative upgrades, safe clears |
| Currency Farming | Vault rooms + global rarity modifiers |
| Boss Progression | Protect routes to Royal Architect, then Atziri |
| Crafting | Corruption chambers + modification benches |

## High-Value Tier 3 Rewards

| Room | Reward | Estimated Value |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Sacrificial Chamber T3 | Vaal Cultivation Orb | ~1.5 Divine |
| Corruption Chamber T3 | Vaal Infuser | ~70 Exalted |
| Thaumaturge Cathedral | Gem Double Corruption | ~50 Exalted |
| Flesh Surgeon T3 | Limb Modification Device | Priceless utility |

---

## Crafting Benches by Room

Tier 3 rooms unlock 17 specialized crafting benches:

| Room Type | Bench Function |
|-----------|----------------|
| Smithy T3 | Quality above 20% |
| Corruption Chamber T3 | Double corrupts |
| Thaumaturge T3 | Gem corruption |
| Sacrificial Chamber T3 | Unique rerolls |
| Flesh Surgeon T3 | Limb prosthetics |

---

## Important Tips

1. **Never rush upgrades** - Tier increases add danger; deaths end runs entirely
2. **Protect high-value chains** - Use medallions consistently
3. **Console shows synergies** - Hover over options to see exact boosts
4. **Use medallions for storage** - Can hold up to 60 beacon charges
5. **Architect shortcuts** - Architect's Chamber connects directly to rooms, not just paths
6. **Deaths waste runs** - Survival is essential; conservative play wins
